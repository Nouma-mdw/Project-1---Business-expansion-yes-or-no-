# Database analysis for business decision
Project 1 of the Coding Bootcamp (October 22 - February 23) - Software: SQL and Tableau

## Backround story ##
Eniac is a company from spain operating through western europe that is planning to expand their business to Brazil. Even though contracts ar being negotiated, it is not yet clear, if the expanison is going to take place. For that decision the board of members wants you, the data specialist, to do your research and inform them, so they can decide to the best of their abilities.

### Backround Information ###
They sell high end tech products.
Some data about the company:
  Revenue: around 40 million €
  AVG monthly revenue: around 1 million €
  AVG order price: 710 €
  AVG item price: 540 €
 
Eniac sells through its own e-commerce store in Europe,
with its own site and direct providers for all steps of the supply chain.
The company identifies with high end tech products, fast deliveries and a professional and friendly tech support.

Brasil is a huge market, but the company doesn't have a network to work with. Therefore it plans on cooperaing with a local OMS and sell through external marketplaces, to get to know the market.

### Focus ##
Main criteria for cooperating with the brazilian OMS are the following questions:
A. Are the marketplaces suitable for high end tech products?
B. Are the deliveries fast enough.
 
### Given Input: ###
Given was a databases "from the OMS" company.
There was information about products, orders, orer items, delivery status,
sellers, among others.

### Task at hand: ###
Give a recommendation to the boardmembers whether they should expand to Brazil in cooperation with the OMS or not.

## Task to accomplish (see word Document - to be uploaded....): ##
### 1) Exploring the database... ###
for different questions that can be answered using the given data, exploring using SQL.
### 2) Setting up struture... ###
...for the "tasks to accomplish" by splitting the questions of the "Focus" into simpler questions
which can be answered using the given database.
Whe had a structure of three layers:
1. Questions (of the focus) that only allowed "Yes" or "No" answers.
    (e.g. Are the market places Magist works with suited for high-end tech?)
2. For each question we chose at least aspect of the OMS. It had to be such an aspect that it 
    would help answer the question with yes or no. That is why we call this aspect an argument:
3. For each argument we derived the necessary facts we needed find out the attributes 
      relevant for the aspect and there for answering the question. 

Overall this structure gave our group orientation and a good possiblity to split tasks among each other.
So we set up a deadline and definied tasks for each and everyone of us.
Actually steps 1) and 2) were iterative and it wasn't just reduced to a linear working process.
Facts got added or changed depending on available data and also a third question was taken into account.
Formulating the goals of research as questions helped us a lot to tackle the task with an "open to every result" mindset, 
by that I mean that we worked from the data to the answer instead of being biased by a certain decision towards any answer 
only looking for data that would support our statement.
Actually there was one fact which, once enriched with data from the context, changed from supporting the decision of cooperating with the OMS
to rejecting it. ANd this argument resulted being decisive.

### 3) Weighting Arguments ###
Each question did have its own arguments for or against or both. These arguments had to be weighted to acertain a final answer.
And in the end the answer to each question was in itself an argument for or against the company working with local OMS.
So the weighting of  arguments happened her to. We used this weighting of arguments for our conclusion.
For the final presentation we decided to present the arguments ordered from weekest to strongest, to let the strongest
argument come at last and so help our audience, fellow sudents, remember our strongest argument best.
